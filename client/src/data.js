Most men naturally begin to produce roughly 1% less testosterone every year after they turn 30, however, some men lose testosterone at a much more rapid rate. For these men who are experiencing low testosterone, also known as hypogonadism, the condition can be exacerbated by conditions such as diabetes or obesity.`,

Men with hypogonadism can greatly benefit from testosterone replacement therapy and many will begin to see results in as little as 3 to 6 weeks. If you think this hormone replacement therapy might work for you, reach out to our team today to see if you qualify for testosterone replacement therapy and learn how we can help you get your energy, motivation, and sex drive back!`,

Men who only rarely experience erectile dysfunction, less than 20% of the time, which can be linked to heightened stress, instability in a relationship, or other temporary difficulties should not be concerned and generally do not need to seek treatment. For men who frequently have difficulty getting an erection during sexual interactions, or for those who are able to get an erection but cannot maintain it at least 50% of the time, treatment options are available at erectile dysfunction treatment centers. Chronic erectile dysfunction can cause severe mental and emotional distress to men if left untreated. If you are struggling with ED symptoms, don’t wait any longer to seek help for your condition: you need an erectile dysfunction doctor.

Not all men with low testosterone (also known as “low T”) will exhibit symptoms, but for those that do, testosterone replacement therapy can be an option. The most common symptoms of low testosterone levels are:`,

    // — Dynamic conclusion pulled straight from data.js! —
    symptomsConclusion: `
      Frequently, the first things that men notice are a lack of energy and a low sex drive. In more severe cases of low testosterone, men may experience erectile dysfunction which can severely hinder their self‐esteem and sex life. With our telehealth testosterone replacement therapy services, we strive to restore hormone levels, erectile function, and sexual performance, which sometimes also results in weight loss and improvement in other health conditions.
