Most men naturally begin to produce roughly 1% less testosterone every year after they turn 30, however, some men lose testosterone at a much more rapid rate. For these men who are experiencing low testosterone, also known as hypogonadism, the condition can be exacerbated by conditions such as diabetes or obesity.`,

Men with hypogonadism can greatly benefit from testosterone replacement therapy and many will begin to see results in as little as 3 to 6 weeks. If you think this hormone replacement therapy might work for you, reach out to our team today to see if you qualify for testosterone replacement therapy and learn how we can help you get your energy, motivation, and sex drive back!`,

Men who only rarely experience erectile dysfunction, less than 20% of the time, which can be linked to heightened stress, instability in a relationship, or other temporary difficulties should not be concerned and generally do not need to seek treatment. For men who frequently have difficulty getting an erection during sexual interactions, or for those who are able to get an erection but cannot maintain it at least 50% of the time, treatment options are available at erectile dysfunction treatment centers. Chronic erectile dysfunction can cause severe mental and emotional distress to men if left untreated. If you are struggling with ED symptoms, don’t wait any longer to seek help for your condition: you need an erectile dysfunction doctor.

In more severe cases of low testosterone, men may experience erectile dysfunction which can severely hinder their self‐esteem and sex life.

        question: "How Common is Low Testosterone?",
        answer: `Low testosterone is common and becomes increasingly more common as men age. 40% of men over the age of 45 have low testosterone levels, with that number increasing to 50% by age 80.

Additionally, low testosterone is more common in men with certain health conditions such as diabetes or obesity. Consistent studies have shown that between 30-50% of men with Type 2 Diabetes also have low testosterone, and 50% of obese men have low testosterone.`
      },
      {
        question: "Can I Stop Taking Testosterone Replacement Therapy When I Feel Better?",
        answer: `Testosterone replacement therapy is a long-term, and sometimes indefinite, solution to men’s hypogonadism. If you suddenly stop taking your prescription, you may begin to experience symptoms of low testosterone again as your body goes back to underproducing the amount that you need.

Most men will be able to go onto a maintenance plan by the end of their first year of testosterone therapy, however, and will only have to come in for checkups once every 6 to 12 months. This is to ensure that your prescription dosage is still working and that you’re still feeling as healthy as you should be.`
      },
      {
        question: "Who is Testosterone Replacement Therapy For?",
        answer: `Testosterone replacement therapy is not for everyone. Only men with symptomatic hypogonadism, with a testosterone level under 300 ng/dL who consistently have several of the accompanying symptoms are eligible for testosterone replacement therapy.

Low testosterone is common, affecting nearly 40% of men over the age of 45. Many men who have low testosterone will not experience any symptoms and will not require treatment for their hypogonadism.`
      },
      {
        question: "Potential Risks of Testosterone Replacement Therapy",
        answer: `The most common side effects associated with testosterone replacement therapy are rashes, itching, or irritation at the application site. Some men may also experience acne, smaller testes, and swelling of the feet or ankles. Because testosterone replacement therapy is a relatively new treatment, its long-term effects of it are still unknown.

Men with certain health conditions should be careful when starting any type of testosterone replacement therapy, as some conditions can be exacerbated during treatment. These conditions include:

• Cardiovascular disease  
• High blood pressure  
• Sleep apnea  
• Congestive heart failure  
• Enlarged prostate or prostate cancer  
• Elevated hematocrit levels (High iron)

Another potential risk is blood clots that can be caused by polycythemia, or a dramatic and abnormal increase in red blood cells. These blood clots primarily occur in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

Additionally, men should avoid testosterone replacement therapy if they are actively trying to have children or plan to have children naturally in the future. TRT can reduce sperm counts significantly and in rare cases may cause infertility.

While this condition is typically reversible, it requires stopping testosterone replacement therapy which can cause previous low-T symptoms to come back.`
      },
      {
        question: "When Will I See Results From Testosterone Replacement Therapy?",
        answer: `It is natural to feel impatient when you begin testosterone replacement therapy. After all, you’ve spent months or years feeling tired and lethargic so of course, you’re ready to feel better now!

Unfortunately, testosterone replacement isn’t an overnight fix. It took years to develop low testosterone, and it takes time to rebuild it. Each person will have a different reaction to the therapy as well depending on their unique situation.

That said, most patients will begin to notice some improvements in their symptoms within 3 to 6 months, and some men may notice a change even sooner. The typical timeframes for reduction of symptoms in patients who undergo testosterone replacement therapy is:

• **3–6 Weeks:** Sex drive and libido increase while symptoms of anxiety and depression decrease. Mood elevates and energy levels increase.  
• **12–16 Weeks:** Some men begin to lose weight as fat levels decrease, inflammation in joints is relieved, and men begin to have an easier time building lean muscle mass and strength.  
• **6–12 Months:** Lipid counts decrease, bone density increases, and insulin sensitivity increases.`
      },
      {
        question: "How Long Should I Stay on Testosterone Therapy?",
        answer: `The answer is different for everyone and it can only be determined on a case-by-case basis by your doctor. For most men, however, testosterone replacement therapy is a long-term, and in some cases indefinite process.

This is because it is often extremely difficult to treat the underlying cause of hypogonadism without testosterone replacement therapy. Men who abruptly stop treatment may begin to experience symptoms of Low-T again.

The good news is that treatment can become more of a maintenance plan once your levels have returned to normal which means that you may not have to receive the therapy as often. Your doctor will set you up with a maintenance plan and check-up schedule to ensure that your testosterone levels are remaining consistent.`

        `There are a wide variety of treatment options available to men who have erectile dysfunction (ED), including prescription medication, penile injections, vascular reconstructive surgery, reducing fatigue, use of a vacuum erection device, and other treatments. These treatments may vary depending on if you have any underlying conditions that could be affected by medication.`,
        `Your doctor will work with you directly to determine the best treatment plan for your situation and symptoms. Typically, erectile dysfunction treatment begins by getting your cardiovascular health under control. They may recommend some lifestyle changes first, such as changing your diet (a healthy diet is essential), lowering blood sugar, exercising more, quitting smoking or drinking, overall health, or switching your current medications.`,
        `If your doctor believes that your erectile dysfunction and sexual problems may be the result of an emotional or psychological condition, they may recommend counseling or therapy. Once these considerations have been addressed, your doctor will then move on to non-invasive treatment options, typically beginning with oral medications, as long as they won’t interfere with any other medications that you may be taking.`,
        `⚠️ If you develop and maintain an erection lasting longer than 4 hours with any of these medications or treatment methods, immediately seek medical attention at your nearest emergency room. If left untreated, prolonged erections can lead to priapism which can cause permanent damage to the penis.`

Known as PDE type-5 drugs, these medications help increase blood flow to the penis in order to achieve and maintain an erection long enough for sexual intercourse.`,
            `These medications do not automatically cause erections by themselves. Instead, they help stimulate the nerves in the penis that are responsible for causing an erection. Sexual stimulation is needed to help stimulate the nitric oxide chemical that helps control penile function.`

            `It is essential that you tell your doctor if you are taking any other medications for chronic health conditions, particularly nitrate drugs, alpha-blockers, or medications for hypotension or hypertension. This combination of medications can cause severe and potentially life-threatening side effects. For men that are not taking any of the above medications, PDE type-5 medications are generally safe. You may experience some mild side effects including facial flushing, headaches, indigestion, muscle aches, and a stuffy nose. These reactions are typically mild and only last for a short time.`
